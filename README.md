## Tell Me a Little Bit About Yourself :sunglasses:

I have been learning front-end web development for more than a year. I specialized in creating accessible websites. 
My strength is my ability to create accessible websites. I pride myself on my reputation in the community by creating responsive and accessible websites. Not only that, every time I have done creating the website, I spare my time to write `README` to explain the process of how I created the website and the things which I learned while making the project.

üìå **I recommend looking through the pinned repositories which showcase my current skills.** üëá

## Technical Skills & Tools

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/html) - The building block of the web. No website can survive without this.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css) - The styling language for the web.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Track the history of my projects. It allows me to break things with no worries.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS pre-processor. It helps me organize my stylesheets while still compiling them into a single CSS file.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Design tool. I use Figma when I am working with a design file. Of course, I am not a designer.
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript) - Programming language for the web browsers.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code editor. I love this tool. It has everything that I need to write code.
